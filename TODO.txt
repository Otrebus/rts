+ Turn InputQueue into serving the user with a bunch of stuff that happened since the last query, like: key was held for this long (even though it might still be held), key was pressed+released. Maybe three different types of events - pressed, pressed+held, released. Removes the need from having to write to timeKey when it was last read, and ugly stuff like that
+ Add some hotkey for changing how the terrain renders - flat, wireframe, normal, and switches between them
- Now that we have geometric normals we don't really need to create a new mesh for flat rendering
+ Make the camera move slower along the terrain instead etc
+ Make camera switch between terrain following and freelook with some key
+ Add some way of drawing lines
+ Fix bmp writing
+ Setting camera position and transform in the materials classes seems a bit weird
+ Fix fov setting
+ Fix cam initialization (specially up)
- Work out memory leaks
+ Add entity system and selection mechanics (point/box)
- Implement path finding
- Triangle picking doesn't pick the closest triangle
- Figure out mesh ownership
- Review the two vertex shaders for lines, if we can unify them
- Work out the relationship between mesh3d and linemesh3d, the latter inherits a bunch of stuff it doesn't need from the former, they should inherit from a common base model or something
+ Fix a better way of assigning a color to selected bounding boxes
