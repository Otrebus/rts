+ Turn InputQueue into serving the user with a bunch of stuff that happened since the last query, like: key was held for this long (even though it might still be held), key was pressed+released. Maybe three different types of events - pressed, pressed+held, released. Removes the need from having to write to timeKey when it was last read, and ugly stuff like that
+ Add some hotkey for changing how the terrain renders - flat, wireframe, normal, and switches between them
- Now that we have geometric normals we don't really need to create a new mesh for flat rendering
+ Make the camera move slower along the terrain instead etc
- Make camera switch between terrain following and freelook with some key
- Add some way of drawing lines
+ Fix bmp writing
- Setting camera position and transform in the materials classes seems a bit weird
- Fix fov setting
- Fix cam initialization (specially up)
